when there is a duplicate row in the target table of mysql.
and we use sqoop export, one of the mapper which is trying to copy the data will fail.
Hence, data will be partially loaded into the mysql table.

To overcome this problem, We use --staging-table.

for this to use, we have to manually create a table in mysql with same structure.

sqoop will first copy the data into staging table and then from staging table to target table.
This will overcome the problem of partial data load, as the primary key constraint will not let even single row to be loaded.

--clear-staging-table // we use this to clear the table, if there is existing data.

sqoop export \
--connect jdbc:mysql://ms.itversity.com/retail_export \
--username retail_user \
--password itversity \
--export-dir /user/hive/warehouse/randeep/orders.db/order_revenue \
--table randeep \
--staging-table randeep_stage \
--clear-staging-table \
--input-fields-terminated-by '\001' \
